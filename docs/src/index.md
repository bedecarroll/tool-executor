# Welcome to tx

tx is a thin, configurable launcher for AI code-assistant sessions. It gives you a fast terminal UI, reproducible pipelines, and integration points for your favourite providers so you can move between conversations without losing context. The latest rendered version of this guide lives at [tx.bedecarroll.com](https://tx.bedecarroll.com).

## Why tx?

- One keystroke launches the TUI, lets you select a session or profile, and runs or inserts the assembled command.
- Search recent work with a prompt-first filter or full-text indexing, then resume a session exactly where it left off.
- Compose providers, pre snippets, post processors, and wrappers with TOML configurationâ€”no bespoke scripting required.
- Keep logs, cache, and configuration under XDG-friendly directories for predictable automation.
- Integrations such as prompt-assembler and the built-in self-update command extend tx without complicating the core workflow.

This book walks through the features from first install to advanced automation so you can make tx part of your daily development loop.
